# ConFusion üç≥
As part of the Coursera AngularJS specialized course, I designed an angular website called "ConFusion" for a fusion restaurant that serves Indian food with a continental touch.

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 6.0.8.

## Development Server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
